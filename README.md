# Hooks Reference

Hooks Reference is a WordPress admin plugin that scans all installed plugins to discover where WordPress hooks (`add_action`, `do_action`, `add_filter`, `apply_filters`) are used. It provides a UI to view and filter these hooks by plugin and hook type.

> **Warning:** This is an experimental plugin I created entirely using Cursor. Even this document was added by Cursorâ€”except for this warning. No coding involved. You might notice a few small bugs here and there.
